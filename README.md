# Assignment-3-SKILLS-IN-UNIVERSITY-AND-INDUSTRY
*This is the third assignment of technology and information system (SECP1513-09).*

**What I have gained:** (๑•̀ㅂ•́)و✧

After the talk, I learnt about the skills that are essential in university and industry, such as technical skills, soft and hard skills and the IRPA method (Identify, Research, Prepare and Apply). I also understood how those skills developed during university can be applied in the workplace. In addition, I gained awareness of how the industry is evolving, learnt about what employers look for most in graduates and how we can start building these skills now.

**My improvement:** (⸝⸝•̀֊•́⸝⸝)

I have improved my ability to listen to key points and take clear notes during the talk. In report writing, I enhanced my ability to summarize, analyze and merge information into a structured report. I also practised presenting technical and non-technical information clearly and briefly in my report.
